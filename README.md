# Database assignment

This application, built with C# and .NET, is designed to interact with a Microsoft SQL database. 
The project uses Entity Framework Core to manage the database connection and operations, implementing both Code-First and Database-First approaches. 
The application allows for full CRUD operations and is structured using the Service and Repository patterns for data management.
The database includes at least 10 tables, normalized to 1st-3rd Normal Forms, with one database handling general data and another for product and production information. 
Unit and integration tests were implemented using an InMemoryDatabase to ensure the functionality of all services and repositories.
